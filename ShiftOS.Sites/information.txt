The ShiftOS Site repo was moved to automate deployment.

However, this also comes at a toll to the rest of you developers:

To help protect the automated deployment system from griefing, trolling etc. from other developers - nobody will have access to this other repo.

There are only two people who are allowed access to the website repository:

- Me (NarodGaming): I own and run the website itself, i even own the hardware it runs on.
- Michael: He owns the damn project, and is trustworthy.

If you believe that you should have access, just PM me on Discord on the forums, and I'll give it a think.

Sorry for any inconvinience caused - but I hope you understand.

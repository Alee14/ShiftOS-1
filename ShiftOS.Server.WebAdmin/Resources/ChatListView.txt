<h3>Chats</h3>

<p>On this page you can find a list of all chats in the system. Chats are a part of the multi-user domain that allows online players to talk to eachother in the 'MUD Chat' application.</p>

<p>If you have a Discord server for your multi-user domain, you can also designate a ShiftOS chat to listen on a specific channel on your server. You will need to create a Discord Bot Token and specify the ID of the channel you want tolisten to.</p>

<p>Once the chat is set up, you should see a bot join your Discord server. Once it does, any messages received by the server in that channel will be relayed into ShiftOS, and any messages received by the MUD in the ShiftOS channel will be relayed to Discord.</p>
